# PES Physical Design

**Course Name** : VLSI Physical Design for ASICs  
**Instructor** : Kunal Ghosh   
**About Course** : This course covers key aspects of RISC-V and chip design, spanning design cycles, RISC-V ISA, analog IPs, and mixed-signal flow. It delves into process design kits, libraries, RTL design synthesis, and gate-level simulation. The curriculum also includes RTL-to-GDS flow, encompassing SoC design implementation from floor planning to post-layout timing analysis.<br>
